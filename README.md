# Assignments of the UvA DL 1 course, edition 2022

## Assignment 1

You can find all necessary instructions in **assignment_1.pdf** on Canvas.

We provide to you simple unit tests that can check your implementation. However, be aware that even if all tests are passed, it still doesn't mean that your implementation is fully correct. You can find tests in **unittests.py**. 
 
We also provide a Conda environment you can use to install the necessary Python packages. For local use on CPU-only machine, use the `dl2022_cpu.yml` environment. For GPU-based machines and Lisa, use the `dl2022_gpu.yml` file. Instructions on how to setup Lisa can be found [here](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/tutorial1/Lisa_Cluster.html), and will be discussed during your first TA session on Friday.
